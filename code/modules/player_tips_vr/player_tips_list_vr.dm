It is recommended to turn on suit sensors to 'TRACKING' before doing anything dangerous like mining, and to turn them off before digestion scenes as prey.",

Generally speaking, people are more likely to interact with you if you are moving about and doing things.

People that are looking for scenes generally like to see how you type and RP before they'll start working towards a scene with you.",
